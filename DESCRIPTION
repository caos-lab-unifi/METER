Title: METER (METhylation analyzER)
Version: 0.2.0
Description:
    METER is a computational tool to analyze TC exploiting iDMS and iDMR in
    lpWGBS data of cfDNA samples. It comprises three modules to measure
    circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), based on tumor-specific iDMS, detect ctDNA,
    based on tumor-specific iDMR, and infer tumor subtypes from ctDNA, based on
    tumor subtype-specific iDMR.
