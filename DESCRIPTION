Title: METER (METhylome analyzER)
Version: 0.3.0
Description:
    METER is an R package designed for analyzing tumor content (TC) in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples
    using low-pass whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (lpWGBS) data. It leverages
    differentially methylated sites (DMS) and regions (DMR) to provide a
    comprehensive computational framework. The package includes three modules,
    METER-quant to measure ctDNA, based on tumor-specific DMS,
    METER-detect to detect ctDNA, based on tumor-specific DMR, 
    METER-subtype to infer tumor subtype from ctDNA, based on tumor subtype-specific DMR.
